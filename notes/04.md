# Tiny React Ch04 Hooks

Okay, before diving into hooks, we need a bit wrap up on the last chapter- still something to fix, but the last chapter was too much, so, well, here it is.

## Fixing the last chapter

Here are some minor things- not entirely bugs, but better to fix them.

### vDOM Comparison

In javascript, two functions are equal only if they are the same, stays unequal even if they have the same procedure, that is,

```javascript
const a = () => 1;
const b = () => 1;
a === b; // false
```

So, when it comes to vDOM Comparison, we should skip the function comparison. Here is the fix,

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < aKeys.length; i++) {
    const key = aKeys[i]
    if (key === 'key') continue
    if (aProps[key] instanceof Function && bProps[key] instanceof Function) continue
    if (aProps[key] !== bProps[key]) return false
}
for (let i = 0; i < bKeys.length; i++) {
    const key = bKeys[i]
    if (key === 'key') continue
    if (aProps[key] instanceof Function && bProps[key] instanceof Function) continue
    if (aProps[key] !== bProps[key]) return false
}
```

### Handling CSS

Style should be treated as a special property that is attributed to element with `.style` property. Here is the fix,

```typescript
export type VDomAttributes = { 
    key?: string | number
    style?: object
    [_: string]: unknown | undefined
}

export function createDom(vDom: VDomNode): HTMLElement | Text {
    if (isElement(vDom)) {
        const element = document.createElement(vDom.tag)
        Object.entries(vDom.props ?? {}).forEach(([name, value]) => {
            if (value === undefined) return
            if (name === 'key') return
            if (name === 'style') {
                Object.entries(value as Record<string, unknown>).forEach(([styleName, styleValue]) => {
                    element.style[styleName as any] = styleValue as any
                })
                return
            }
            if (name.startsWith('on') && value instanceof Function) {
                element.addEventListener(name.slice(2).toLowerCase(), value as EventListener)
            } else {
                element.setAttribute(name, value?.toString() ?? "")
            }
        })
        return element
    } else {
        return document.createTextNode(vDom)
    }
}
```

Now these side fixes are done, let's move on to the main topic of this chapter- Hooks.

### Capsuling vDOM Creation

We previously explicitly called ` render(vDom, app!)`, which requires creating vDOM by user, here is a better way to do it.

```tsx
import { mount, useState, type FuncComponent } from "./runtime";
import { createElement, fragment, VDomAttributes, VDomNode } from "./v-dom";

const App: FuncComponent = (props: VDomAttributes, __: VDomNode[]) => {
    const [cnt, setCnt] = useState(0)
    return <div>
        <button onClick={() => setCnt(cnt() + 1)}>Click me</button>
        <p>Count: {cnt()}</p>
    </div>
}
const app = document.getElementById('app')
mount(App, {}, [], app!)
```

```typescript
let reRender: () => void = () => {}
export function mount(app: FuncComponent, props: VDomAttributes, children: VDomNode[], parent: HTMLElement) {
    reRender = () => {
        const vDom = app(props, children) as unknown as VDomNode
        render(vDom, parent)
    }
    reRender()
}
```

Looks better more or less. Now let's move on to the main topic of this chapter- Hooks.

## useState

Okay, let's get to the hook. The first hook we are going to implement is `useState`. It is a hook that allows us to manage the state of a component. We can have the following signature for `useState`,

Note that our implementation is slightly different from the original React. We are going to return a getter and a setter function, instead of returning the state directly.

```typescript
function useState<T>(initialValue: T): [() => T, (newValue: T) => void] {
    // implementation
}
```

So where will we hook the value at? If we just hide it within the closure itself, the value will be lost when the component is re-rendered. If you insist on doing so, you need to access the space of the outer function, which is not possible in javascript.

So our way is to store it, you guessed it, in fiber. So, let's add a field to the fiber.

```typescript
interface Fiber {
    parent: Fiber | null
    sibling: Fiber | null
    child: Fiber | null
    vDom: VDomNode
    dom: HTMLElement | Text | null
    alternate: Fiber | null
    committed: boolean
    hooks?: {
        state: unknown[]
    },
    hookIndex?: {
        state: number
    }
}
```

And we only mount hooks to the root fiber, so we can add the following line to the `mount` function.

```typescript
export function render(vDom: VDomNode, parent: HTMLElement) {
    wip = {
        parent: null,
        sibling: null,
        child: null,
        vDom: vDom,
        dom: null,
        committed: false,
        alternate: oldFiber,
        hooks: oldFiber?.hooks ?? {
            state: []
        },
        hookIndex: {
            state: 0
        }
    }
    wipParent = parent
    nextUnitOfWork = wip
}
```

Hook index will come into use later. Now, hook index resets every time the component is re-rendered, but old hooks are carried over.

Please note that, we rendering component vDOM, only old fiber is accessible, so we can only manipulate that variable. However, it is null at the very beginning, so let's set up a dummy.

```typescript
export function mount(app: FuncComponent, props: VDomAttributes, children: VDomNode[], parent: HTMLElement) {
    reRender = () => {
        if(!oldFiber) {
            oldFiber = {
                parent: null,
                sibling: null,
                child: null,
                vDom: null as any,
                dom: null,
                committed: false,
                alternate: null,
                hooks: {
                    state: []
                },
                hookIndex: {
                    state: 0
                }
            }
        }
        const vDom = app(props, children) as unknown as VDomNode
        render(vDom, parent)
        console.log('rerender')
        console.log(vDom)
    }
    reRender()
}
```

Now we will have big brain time- since the order of each hook call is fixed (you can not use hooks in a loop or a condition, basic React rule, you know why it is now), so we can use safely use `hookIndex` to access the hook.

```typescript
export function useState<T>(initialState: T): [T, (newState: T) => void] {
    const hookIndex = oldFiber!.hookIndex!.state
    oldFiber!.hookIndex!.state++
    oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] = oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] ?? initialState
    console.log(oldFiber!.hooks!.state)
    const state = oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex]
    const setState = (newState: T) => {
        oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] = newState
        reRender!()
    }
    return [state as T, setState]
}
```

Well, let's try,

```tsx
import { mount, useState, type FuncComponent } from "./runtime";
import { createElement, fragment, VDomAttributes, VDomNode } from "./v-dom";

const App: FuncComponent = (props: VDomAttributes, __: VDomNode[]) => {
    const [cnt, setCnt] = useState(0)
    return <div>
        <button onClick={() => setCnt(cnt + 1)}>Click me</button>
        <p>Count: {cnt}</p>
    </div>
}
const app = document.getElementById('app')
mount(App, {}, [], app!)
```

It kind of works- the count increased from zero to one, but it does not increase further.

Well... strange right? Let's see what's going on, debug time.

```tsx
const App: FuncComponent = (props: VDomAttributes, __: VDomNode[]) => {
    const [cnt, setCnt] = useState(0)
    return <div>
        <button onClick={() => {
            console.log(cnt + 1)
            console.log("FROM COMPONENT")
            setCnt(cnt + 1)
        }}>Click me</button>
        <p>Count: {cnt}</p>
    </div>
}
const app = document.getElementById('app')
mount(App, {}, [], app!)
```

You will see that, it always log 1. But the web page tells us that it is 1, so it should be 2. What's going on?

For native types, javascript passes by value, so the value is copied, not referenced. In React class component, it requires you to have a state object to address the issues. In functional component, the React addresses with, closure. But if we were to use the latter, it requires a big change in our code. So a simple way to get pass is, using function to get the state, so that the function will always return the latest state.

```typescript
export function useState<T>(initialState: T): [() => T, (newState: T) => void] {
    const hookIndex = oldFiber!.hookIndex!.state
    oldFiber!.hookIndex!.state++
    oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] = oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] ?? initialState
    console.log(oldFiber!.hooks!.state)
    const state = () => oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] as T
    const setState = (newState: T) => {
        oldFiber!.hooks!.state[hookIndex] = newState
        reRender!()
    }
    return [state, setState]
}
```

And now, here we got it! It works! We created the `useState` hook for our tiny React.

## Summary

Okay, you may believe that this chapter is too short- hooks are important to react, so why did we only implement `useState`?

First, many hooks are just variations of `useState`. Such hook is irrelevant to the component it is called, for example, `useMemo`. Such things are just trivial works and we got no time to waste.

But, second, the most important reason, is that, for hooks like `useEffect`, under our current, root-update based frame, they are nearly impossible to do. When a fiber unmount, you can not signal, because we only fetch the global vDOM and update the whole vDOM, whereas, in real React, it's not like so.

In real React, functional components are updated by the parent component, so the parent component can signal the child component to unmount. But in our case, we only update the root component, so we can not signal the child component to unmount.
